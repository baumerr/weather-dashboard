## Description

This application is for the user to find accurate weather information for any city just by typing the name of the city they want to know about.


## Installation

Since this application is a web application, no installation is required. Just go to https://baumerr.github.io/weather-dashboard/


## Instructions

When you arrive at the homepage, you just type the city of which you are looking to get the weather for and click the search icon. When the page loads you will get information about the weather today as well as a 5 day forecast of the same city. You also notice under the search bar that there is a history section that you can click on to get the weather for any previous city's you have searched. If you leave the page and come back you'll notice your history is still there. This is because your search history is saved in your browser's local storage.
